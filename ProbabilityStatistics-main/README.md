# ProbabilityStatistics

Lab 1: basic functions implementation (choose, square, factorial, pascalâ€™s
identity), for and while loops, cat function.

Lab 2: simulating artificial data.

Lab 4: Monte Carlo approach of simulating and plotting data, check event
functions to (coins and ice cream problem)

Lab 6: ice cream problem, same birthday problem

Lab 7 : judge, signal, correct way to input elements into a matrix

Lab 9: salesmen problem

Lab 11: random variables examples with machine problem

Lab 12 : random variables histograms, pmf, cdf, more random variables
examples

Probability and frequency : all the Monte Carlo simulations already present
with some new examples, more examples of random variables while
simulating the random variables, relevant functions in R for a binomial RV
and representing them in a histogram, pmf,cdf , variance of a binomial
random variable continuous random variables introduction.
